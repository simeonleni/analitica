# Analitica Analysis

## Problem statement 
We are trying to understand the factors that influence whether a company has affected employees. This is important because companies with affected employees may require additional support or interventions. By identifying the key factors, we can target our interventions more effectively and potentially prevent employees from being affected in the future.

To solve this problem, we will use this dataset to build a predictive model. This model will take as input the various financial and operational characteristics of a company and output a prediction of whether the company has affected employees. We can then use this model to predict the status of new companies and guide our interventions.
